# Webscraper
Webscraper built in Python using Beautiful Soup. This outputs a .csv file with all listings in the latest four pages of apartment rental listings. While this works, Craiglist strict no-scraping policies may result in a banned IP. In this repository is an output example (.csv) of a scrape of Toronto's rental listings (executed on April 25th 2018).
